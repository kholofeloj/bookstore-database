# ðŸ“˜ **Bookstore Database Overview**


## ðŸŽ¯Goal of the Project 

Building a relational database that stores information about the bookstore's operations, including books, authors, customers, orders, shipping and more.

The database efficiently stores all necessary data and allows for quick Retrieval and Analysis.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# **What Each Part of the Code Does**


## Database Creation

<br/>

```
CREATE DATABASE bookStoreDB;
USE bookStoreDB;
```
<br/>

- Creates new dabase named `bookStoreDB` and sets it as the active database for the rest of the operations.

<br/>
<br/>


## Reference Tables

These tables store basic, reusable values:

- `country`: List of countries used in addresses.
- `adress_status`: Defines the type of a customer's address (e.g. Home, work).
- `book_language`: Languages in which books are available.
- `shipping_method`: shipping options with associated costs.
- `order_status`: Tracks the order progress
